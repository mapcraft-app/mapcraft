### [Go to the official website](https://mapcraft.app/)

## Setup
1. Download the latest stable version [here](https://github.com/mapcraft-app/mapcraft/releases)
2. Install it in the folder of your choice
3. Now you just have to launch the executable.

##### <span>&#x26a0;</span> If you wish, it is possible to have access to the Mapcraft editing tools just by installing the [datapack](https://github.com/mapcraft-app/datapack) and [resourcepack](https://github.com/mapcraft-app/resource-pack) manually, but the other components will not be usable
